"""
LocalBackend — platform-aware subprocess execution backend.

Detects whether FORGE is running on Windows or Linux/macOS and routes
execution accordingly.  Callers never inspect sys.platform — they call
LocalBackend.execute() and receive a structured ExecutionResult.

Binary resolution:
- Always uses shutil.which() to locate a tool; never assumes a hardcoded path.
- On Windows, also checks for .exe / .cmd / .bat variants automatically via
  pathext handling in shutil.which().
- If the binary is not found, returns ExecutionResult(status=MISSING_TOOL)
  immediately — no silent fallback to a different tool.

python / python3:
- On Windows  shutil.which('python3') may be absent; falls back to 'python'.
- On Linux    shutil.which('python') may point to python2; prefers 'python3'.
  The backend resolves this at execute() time for PYTHON_EXEC capability.
