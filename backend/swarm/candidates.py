"""Phase 5 §9/§11/§16/§18-21 — candidate next-action generation.

Given everything currently known (the shared mission state, fresh evidence,
relevant historical experience, and applicable playbooks), produce a set of
structured :class:`~backend.swarm.reasoning.CandidateAction` proposals. The
:class:`~backend.swarm.scoring.ActionScorer` then ranks them and the supervisor /
coordinator turns the best into a schedulable task.

Four complementary sources feed the generator — deterministic, so it runs with no
LLM in tests:

  1. **State-gap actions (§11)** — from what is *unknown*: no services → fingerprint;
     no surface → enumerate; a known vuln not yet exploited → exploit; an artifact →
     analyse/decode. This is the reusable information-gain mechanism.
  2. **Evidence actions (§16)** — an ELF artifact justifies file/strings/checksum
     actions; a versioned service justifies targeted vuln research; etc.
  3. **Memory actions (§18/§19)** — relevant past experience is *advisory*: it
     proposes a candidate carrying its historical confidence/success-rate, but the
     candidate still competes on the current evidence and is never auto-executed.
  4. **Playbook actions (§20/§21)** — an applicable playbook technique is *adapted*
     to the current target/evidence, not blindly executed; if the current target is
     the wrong KIND for the technique, or its capability is unavailable, the
     candidate is dropped or its capability recorded so the pre-dispatch gate handles
     it (reusing Phase 4.x controls).

Memory/playbook retrieval is bounded (§18) and goes exclusively through the EXISTING
``memory_retriever`` singleton — no second memory database is created.
