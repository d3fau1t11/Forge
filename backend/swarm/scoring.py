"""Phase 5 §10/§11 — deterministic candidate-action scoring & information gain.

The planner may propose many candidate next actions; this module ranks them with a
transparent, inspectable, fully-deterministic formula. No LLM decides the final
number — an LLM may *propose* a candidate (with prose fields), but the score that
selects it is computed here from labelled inputs, so it is testable and explainable
(§10, §35, §37).

    score =  w_ig   · information_gain
           + w_ev   · evidence_support
           + w_sp   · success_probability
           + w_nov  · novelty
           − w_cost · cost
           − w_risk · risk
           − duplicate_penalty
           − dependency_penalty          (a candidate whose capability is unavailable)

Every term is in [0, 1] before weighting; the weighted sum is returned together with
a per-term breakdown so the coordinator can log *why* an action was chosen.
