# ============================================================================ #
# Schema migrations — a versioned list, deliberately NOT Alembic
#
# `Base.metadata.create_all()` only creates tables that don't exist yet; it never
# alters an existing one. So every column added to a model AFTER a database was
# first created needs an explicit ALTER TABLE for that database. That used to be
# 20 bare `try/except: pass` blocks, which swallowed a genuinely broken migration
# (locked db, typo'd type, malformed schema) exactly as quietly as the expected
# "column already exists" case — and left no record of what had been applied, so
# no database could tell you what schema it was actually at.
#
# Now: an ordered, numbered list, applied once each and recorded in the
# `schema_version` table.
#
# ORDERED AND APPEND-ONLY. Never renumber or reword an existing entry: live
# databases record version numbers, so editing a statement under an
# already-recorded number means the edit never runs anywhere. New migrations go
# at the end, with the next number.
